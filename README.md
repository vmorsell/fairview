# Fairview – Unbiased Hiring on LinkedIn

Fairview is a browser extension that removes unconscious bias from LinkedIn sourcing by blurring profile pictures, names, and premium badges, allowing you to focus on skills rather than appearance.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically blurs **profile pictures**, **names**, and **LinkedIn subscriptions**.
- Toggle the blur effect on and off via the extension popup.
- Works seamlessly with LinkedIn's UI.

## 🌍 Browser Compatibility

Fairview is designed for Chromium-based browsers. It has been tested and confirmed to work in:

- Google Chrome
- Brave
- Microsoft Edge

It should also work in other Chromium-based browsers like Opera and Vivaldi, though they have not been tested.

🚫 Not yet supported in Firefox, Safari, and other non-Chromium browsers.
